            <p class="info">

                Hello, my name is Aniket, and I'm an experienced financial adviser who's helped over 38 people grow
                their
                financial portfolios. I've helped individuals develop their financial performance and I've provided
                education to ensure their long-term success. I enjoy educating new or existing customers regarding
                financial
                decisions to help them understand more about investing and managing their funds.
                Its important for you, as the consumer, to understand what your planner recommends and why. You should
                not follow an advisors recommendations unquestioningly; its your money, and you should understand how
                its being deployed. Keep a close eye on the fees you are payingâ€”both to your advisor and for any funds
                bought for you.

                Ask your advisor why they recommend specific investments and whether they are receiving a commission for
                selling you those investments. Be alert for possible conflicts of interest.
